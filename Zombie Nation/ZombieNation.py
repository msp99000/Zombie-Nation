     ******* DOCUMENTATION *******
     *****************************

     ZOMBIE NATION ðŸ§Ÿ is an interactive GUI game built on top of Python's Turtle module.
     Developer: 'STUDENT NAME'
     Reviewer: 'REVIEWER NAME'

     The game consists of two characters:
     1. Bob the turtle
     2. Zombini the zombie ðŸ§Ÿ

     "Bob" the turtle out of nowhere enters the 'ZOMBIE NATION', unfortunately! to eventually lead to nothing besides
      a whole new level of intimidation. "Bob" encounters "Zombini" who's been starving since long.
      All he can think right now is run-for-his-life. "Bob" learns quickly that "Zombini" is weak and might not be
      able to carry the chase for longer than ~ 30 secs. "Bob" somehow needs to survive for at least 30 secs to save his life.

      ******************
      **** CONTROLS ****
      ******************

      In this game, the player will be controlling the turtle with the help of arrow keys.
      The player is recommended to stay as far as possible from the zombie.
      The player needs to avoid collision with the zombie. If the zombie somehow succeeds in hitting the same co-ordinates as the players recent position, the player loses the game.
      The speed of zombie increases every 10 secs. The zombie will be fastest in his last cycle.
      To win this game, the player will need to avoid zombie collision for at least 30 secs.
      Scores are calculate on the basis of time.
      If the score goes past 50, the player wins.

    To begin with, I have imported few libraries which include time, turtle and random.
    time library will provide time methods which will help control out game.
    turtle module provides all basic methods which help in building and interacting with the GUI
    random is used generating random numbers

   Here I generated a screen to work with.
   Defined some basic variables to get started with:
   1. Bob
   2. Zombini
   3. Boundary (To create a boundary or end points)
   4. 'new_score' reads the updated score on top left side of screen
   5. 'total_time' reads the updated time on top left side of the screen 
   6. 'img' and 'img2' stores a list of images to be used for GUI
